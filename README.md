# My website

See it live at [jesuslencina.ar](https://www.jesuslencina.ar/)

## Why?

Because I wanted to have a professional portfolio space to showcase my projects.

## Interesting features

-   Available in both English and Spanish
-   Color will change on reload and language switch (if default color isn't of your liking, you can do either)
-   An easter egg

## Stuff I used

-   [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for prototyping and SVG creation
-   [BoxySVG](https://boxy-svg.com/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for SVG handling

-   [ReactSVG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg) for SVG handling in React
