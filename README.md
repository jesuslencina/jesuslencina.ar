# My website

See it live at [jesuslencina.ar](https://www.jesuslencina.ar/)

## Why?

Because I wanted to have a professional portfolio space to showcase my projects.

## Interesting features

-   Available in both English and Spanish
-   Color will change on reload and language switch (if default color isn't of your liking, you can do either)
-   An easter egg

## Stuff I used

For now, just mentioned, will link them up later:

-   Figma for prototyping and SVG creation
-   BoxySVG and Inkscape for SVG handling
-   Styled components for styling
-   ReactSVG for SVG handling in React
-   React Icons and Twemazing for icons and emojis
-   React Scroll for linking up sections in the navbar
-   Uniqolor for color generation
